An iOS step counter application inspired by Ash Ketchum's Pok√©mon journey, emphasizing that growth and continuous improvement are as important as achieving the goal.

## :memo: Description

With features like customizable step goals, the app caters to both beginners looking to ease into a healthier lifestyle and advanced users trying to push their limits.
